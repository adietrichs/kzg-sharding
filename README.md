# Universal Verification for Ethereum's Data Availability Sampling

This project implements an efficient universal verification technique for Ethereum's Data Availability Sampling.

Please read https://ethresear.ch/t/a-universal-verification-equation-for-data-availability-sampling/ for more details on the cryptography and techniques involved.

The verifier code can be seen in `verifier.py` and you can run the tests with `python tests.py`.

This is a PoC for demonstration purposes and by no means production-ready software.
